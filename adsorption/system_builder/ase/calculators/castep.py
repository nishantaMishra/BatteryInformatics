CASTEP Interface Documentation


Introduction
============

CASTEP_ [1]_ W_ is a software package which uses density functional theory to
provide a good atomic-level description of all manner of materials and
molecules. CASTEP can give information about total energies, forces and
stresses on an atomic system, as well as calculating optimum geometries, band
structures, optical spectra, phonon spectra and much more. It can also perform
molecular dynamics simulations.

The CASTEP calculator interface class offers intuitive access to all CASTEP
settings and most results. All CASTEP specific settings are accessible via
attribute access (*i.e*. ``calc.param.keyword = ...`` or
``calc.cell.keyword = ...``)


Getting Started:
================

Set the environment variables appropriately for your system::

    export CASTEP_COMMAND=' ... '
    export CASTEP_PP_PATH=' ... '

Note: alternatively to CASTEP_PP_PATH one can set PSPOT_DIR
as CASTEP consults this by default, i.e.::

    export PSPOT_DIR=' ... '


Running the Calculator
======================

The default initialization command for the CASTEP calculator is

.. class:: Castep(directory='CASTEP', label='castep')

To do a minimal run one only needs to set atoms, this will use all
default settings of CASTEP, meaning LDA, singlepoint, etc..

With a generated *castep_keywords.json* in place all options are accessible
by inspection, *i.e.* tab-completion. This works best when using ``ipython``.
All options can be accessed via ``calc.param.<TAB>`` or ``calc.cell.<TAB>``
and documentation is printed with ``calc.param.<keyword> ?`` or
``calc.cell.<keyword> ?``. All options can also be set directly
using ``calc.keyword = ...`` or ``calc.KEYWORD = ...`` or even
``ialc.KeYwOrD`` or directly as named arguments in the call to the constructor
(*e.g.* ``Castep(task='GeometryOptimization')``).
If using this calculator on a machine without CASTEP, one might choose to copy
a *castep_keywords.json* file generated elsewhere in order to access this
feature: the file will be used if located in the working directory,
*$HOME/.ase/* or *ase/ase/calculators/* within the ASE library. The file should
be generated the first time it is needed, but you can generate a new keywords
file in the currect directory with ``python -m ase.calculators.castep``.

All options that go into the ``.param`` file are held in an ``CastepParam``
instance, while all options that go into the ``.cell`` file and don't belong
to the atoms object are held in an ``CastepCell`` instance. Each instance can
be created individually and can be added to calculators by attribute
assignment, *i.e.* ``calc.param = param`` or ``calc.cell = cell``.

All internal variables of the calculator start with an underscore (_).
All cell attributes that clearly belong into the atoms object are blocked.
Setting ``calc.atoms_attribute`` (*e.g.* ``= positions``) is sent directly to
the atoms object.


Arguments:
==========

=========================  ====================================================
Keyword                    Description
=========================  ====================================================
``directory``              The relative path where all input and output files
                           will be placed. If this does not exist, it will be
                           created.  Existing directories will be moved to
                           directory-TIMESTAMP unless self._rename_existing_dir
                           is set to false.

``label``                  The prefix of .param, .cell, .castep, etc. files.

``castep_command``         Command to run castep. Can also be set via the bash
                           environment variable ``CASTEP_COMMAND``. If none is
                           given or found, will default to ``castep``

``check_castep_version``   Boolean whether to check if the installed castep
                           version matches the version from which the available
                           options were deduced. Defaults to ``False``.

``castep_pp_path``         The path where the pseudopotentials are stored. Can
                           also be set via the bash environment variables
                           ``PSPOT_DIR`` (preferred) and ``CASTEP_PP_PATH``.
                           Will default to the current working directory if
                           none is given or found. Note that pseudopotentials
                           may be generated on-the-fly if they are not found.

``find_pspots``            Boolean whether to search for pseudopotentials in
                           ``<castep_pp_path>`` or not. If activated, files in
                           this directory will be checked for typical names. If
                           files are not found, they will be generated on the
                           fly, depending on the ``_build_missing_pspots``
                           value.  A RuntimeError will be raised in case
                           multiple files per element are found. Defaults to
                           ``False``.
``keyword_tolerance``      Integer to indicate the level of tolerance to apply
                           validation of any parameters set in the CastepCell
                           or CastepParam objects against the ones found in
                           castep_keywords. Levels are as following:

                           0 = no tolerance, keywords not found in
                           castep_keywords will raise an exception

                           1 = keywords not found will be accepted but produce
                           a warning (default)

                           2 = keywords not found will be accepted silently

                           3 = no attempt is made to look for
                           castep_keywords.json at all
``castep_keywords``        Can be used to pass a CastepKeywords object that is
                           then used with no attempt to actually load a
                           castep_keywords.json file. Most useful for debugging
                           and testing purposes.

=========================  ====================================================


Additional Settings
===================

=========================  ====================================================
Internal Setting           Description
=========================  ====================================================
``_castep_command``        (``=castep``): the actual shell command used to
                           call CASTEP.

``_check_checkfile``       (``=True``): this makes write_param() only
                           write a continue or reuse statement if the
                           addressed .check or .castep_bin file exists in the
                           directory.

``_copy_pspots``           (``=False``): if set to True the calculator will
                           actually copy the needed pseudo-potential (\*.usp)
                           file, usually it will only create symlinks.

``_link_pspots``           (``=True``): if set to True the calculator will
                           actually will create symlinks to the needed pseudo
                           potentials. Set this option (and ``_copy_pspots``)
                           to False if you rather want to access your pseudo
                           potentials using the PSPOT_DIR environment variable
                           that is read by CASTEP.
                           *Note:* This option has no effect if ``copy_pspots``
                           is True..

``_build_missing_pspots``  (``=True``): if set to True, castep will generate
                           missing pseudopotentials on the fly. If not, a
                           RuntimeError will be raised if not all files were
                           found.

``_export_settings``       (``=True``): if this is set to
                           True, all calculator internal settings shown here
                           will be included in the .param in a comment line (#)
                           and can be read again by merge_param. merge_param
                           can be forced to ignore this directive using the
                           optional argument ``ignore_internal_keys=True``.

``_force_write``           (``=True``): this controls wether the \*cell and
                           \*param will be overwritten.

``_prepare_input_only``    (``=False``): If set to True, the calculator will
                           create \*cell und \*param file but not
                           start the calculation itself.
                           If this is used to prepare jobs locally
                           and run on a remote cluster it is recommended
                           to set ``_copy_pspots = True``.

``_castep_pp_path``        (``='.'``) : the place where the calculator
                           will look for pseudo-potential files.

``_find_pspots``           (``=False``): if set to True, the calculator will
                           try to find the respective pseudopotentials from
                           <_castep_pp_path>. As long as there are no multiple
                           files per element in this directory, the auto-detect
                           feature should be very robust. Raises a RuntimeError
                           if required files are not unique (multiple files per
                           element). Non existing pseudopotentials will be
                           generated, though this could be dangerous.

``_rename_existing_dir``   (``=True``) : when using a new instance
                           of the calculator, this will move directories out of
                           the way that would be overwritten otherwise,
                           appending a date string.

``_set_atoms``             (``=False``) : setting this to True will overwrite
                           any atoms object previously attached to the
                           calculator when reading a \.castep file.  By de-
                           fault, the read() function will only create a new
                           atoms object if none has been attached and other-
                           wise try to assign forces etc. based on the atom's
                           positions.  ``_set_atoms=True`` could be necessary
                           if one uses CASTEP's internal geometry optimization
                           (``calc.param.task='GeometryOptimization'``)
                           because then the positions get out of sync.
                           *Warning*: this option is generally not recommended
                           unless one knows one really needs it. There should
                           never be any need, if CASTEP is used as a
                           single-point calculator.

``_track_output``          (``=False``) : if set to true, the interface
                           will append a number to the label on all input
                           and output files, where n is the number of calls
                           to this instance. *Warning*: this setting may con-
                           sume a lot more disk space because of the additio-
                           nal \*check files.

``_try_reuse``             (``=_track_output``) : when setting this, the in-
                           terface will try to fetch the reuse file from the
                           previous run even if _track_output is True. By de-
                           fault it is equal to _track_output, but may be
                           overridden.

                           Since this behavior may not always be desirable for
                           single-point calculations. Regular reuse for *e.g.*
                           a geometry-optimization can be achieved by setting
                           ``calc.param.reuse = True``.

``_pedantic``              (``=False``) if set to true, the calculator will
                           inform about settings probably wasting a lot of CPU
                           time or causing numerical inconsistencies.

=========================  ====================================================

Special features:
=================


``.dryrun_ok()``
  Runs ``castep_command seed -dryrun`` in a temporary directory return True if
  all variables initialized ok. This is a fast way to catch errors in the
  input. Afterwards _kpoints_used is set.

``.merge_param()``
  Takes a filename or filehandler of a .param file or CastepParam instance and
  merges it into the current calculator instance, overwriting current settings

``.keyword.clear()``
  Can be used on any option like ``calc.param.keyword.clear()`` or
  ``calc.cell.keyword.clear()`` to return to the CASTEP default.

``.initialize()``
  Creates all needed input in the ``_directory``. This can then copied to and
  run in a place without ASE or even python.

``.set_pspot('<library>')``
  This automatically sets the pseudo-potential for all present species to
  ``<Species>_<library>.usp``. Make sure that ``_castep_pp_path`` is set
  correctly. Note that there is no check, if the file actually exists. If it
  doesn't castep will crash! You may want to use ``find_pspots()`` instead.

``.find_pspots(pspot=<library>, suffix=<suffix>)``
  This automatically searches for pseudopotentials of type
  ``<Species>_<library>.<suffix>`` or ``<Species>-<library>.<suffix>`` in
  ``castep_pp_path` (make sure this is set correctly). Note that ``<Species>``
  will be searched for case insensitive.  Regular expressions are accepted, and
  arguments ``'*'`` will be regarded as bash-like wildcards. Defaults are any
  ``<library>`` and any ``<suffix>`` from ``['usp', 'UPF', 'recpot']``. If you
  have well-organized folders with pseudopotentials of one kind, this should
  work with the defaults.

``print(calc)``
  Prints a short summary of the calculator settings and atoms.

``ase.io.castep.read_seed('path-to/seed')``
  Given you have a combination of seed.{param,cell,castep} this will return an
  atoms object with the last ionic positions in the .castep file and all other
  settings parsed from the .cell and .param file. If no .castep file is found
  the positions are taken from the .cell file. The output directory will be
  set to the same directory, only the label is preceded by 'copy_of\_'  to
  avoid overwriting.

``.set_kpts(kpoints)``
  This is equivalent to initialising the calculator with
  ``calc = Castep(kpts=kpoints)``. ``kpoints`` can be specified in many
  convenient forms: simple Monkhorst-Pack grids can be specified e.g.
  ``(2, 2, 3)`` or ``'2 2 3'``; lists of specific weighted k-points can be
  given in reciprocal lattice coordinates e.g.
  ``[[0, 0, 0, 0.25], [0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.75]]``; a dictionary syntax is
  available for more complex requirements e.g.
  ``{'size': (2, 2, 2), 'gamma': True}`` will give a Gamma-centered 2x2x2 M-P
  grid, ``{'density': 10, 'gamma': False, 'even': False}`` will give a mesh
  with density of at least 10 Ang (based on the unit cell of currently-attached
  atoms) with an odd number of points in each direction and avoiding the Gamma
  point.

``.set_bandpath(bandpath)``
  This is equivalent to initialialising the calculator with
  ``calc=Castep(bandpath=bandpath)`` and may be set simultaneously with *kpts*.
  It allows an electronic band structure path to be set up using ASE BandPath
  objects. This enables a band structure calculation to be set up conveniently
  using e.g. calc.set_bandpath(atoms.cell.bandpath().interpolate(npoints=200))

``.band_structure(bandfile=None)``
  Read a band structure from _seedname.bands_ file. This returns an ase
  BandStructure object which may be plotted with e.g.
  ``calc.band_structure().plot()``

Notes/Issues:
==============

* Currently *only* the FixAtoms *constraint* is fully supported for reading and
  writing. There is some experimental support for the FixCartesian constraint.

* There is no support for the CASTEP *unit system*. Units of eV and Angstrom
  are used throughout. In particular when converting total energies from
  different calculators, one should check that the same CODATA_ version is
  used for constants and conversion factors, respectively.

        This one is more flexible than set_pspots, and also checks if the files
        are actually available from the castep_pp_path.

        Essentially, the function parses the filenames in <castep_pp_path> and
        does a regex matching. The respective pattern is:
