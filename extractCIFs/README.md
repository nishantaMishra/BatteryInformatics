The API no longer allows for the extraction of the raw CIF data. Instead, It is advised to obtain the structure objects and output the data to the CIF format using the built-in 'to' function.

###extractCIF.py
This script will extract the data for the provided material IDs and store it as .cif file.

###extractCIF2.py
For long dataset.
This script reads Material IDs from a specified column of a csv file and saves it as csv file.
